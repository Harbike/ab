* to open developer tools on chrome
Ctrl+shift+j
right-click>>inspect>>console

* basic operations
alert, addition &subtraction, if statement to alert a string if true

NOTE: PART1 JSFundamentals, VIDZ 3-9 missing >> RESOLVED
* vid 3 - INTRO TO JavaScript
-- ES6: ECMAScript
* operators precedence (check MDN)

* Strings using Template Literals: write strings in a normal way and insert variables without needing to concatenate
* Type coercion: changes datatype to fit operation

*to add emoji
WINDOWS + .(period)

* CONTROL STRUCTURES:- if else statement, loops
* if, else statement
// WHERE ? = condition
//         : = else

* approximate to one decimal number
variableName.toFixed(decimalPlace)
e.g markBMI.toFixed(1)
//it returns a string, to convert back to number:-
parseFloat(approxiimatededValue)

* Type conversion and coercion
conversion: manually convert dataTypes
coercion: js automatically converts type behind the scene for us

* NaN - typeof is a number, but an invalid number

* truthy and Falsy values
* equality operator and Boolean logic

** NOTE: PART1 JSFundamentals, VIDZ 20 corrupted!!! 

* 21 - SWITCH STATEMENT
>> switch(variable){
	case "value":
	console.log(`lorem jisdk ajuid`);
	break;
	default:
	console.log(`never!`);
>> }

* 22 STATEMENTS and EXPRESSIONS
-- expressions produce a value, could be a random "3-4" (could be referred to as WORDS)
-- statements; a bigger piece of code, do not produce a value on its own (could be referred to as a SENTENCE)

* 23 Conditional (Ternary) Operator
condition ? action code : else code 

* 25 JS Releases
DURING DEVELOPMENT: use latest browser
DURING PRODUCTION: use Babel to transpile and polyfill code (this converts back to ES5 to ensure browser compatibility for all users)

*********
PART2 JSFundamentals
* ACTIVATE STRICT MODE
first statement in your script
'use strict'; 

* Functions: reusable code blocks
	Function Declaration
	Function Expression
	Arrow Function
** ARRAY
Array Methods:- indexOf() >> includes(), push(adds element to the END of array), unshift(add element to the BEGINNING of array), pop(removes element from the END of array), shift(remove element from the BEGINNING of array)

** OBJECT
* Dot vs Bracket Notation:- dele.lastName OR dele['lastName']
* function attached to an object is called a METHOD.
* 'this' keyword

** Challenge 15
* ITERATION (LOOPS)
// for loop - contains a counter, a condition and updateCounter(increase/decrease)
* // continue: EXIT CURRENT ITRATION AND PROCEED WITH THE REST
// break: TERMINATE THE LOOP
* Backward Loops and Loops in Loops
* Loop in a loop (similar to forEach loop)
* // while loop: you can only specify the condition.. the counter is declared outside the loop

** Math.random() - generates diff. numbers between 0 and 1




** LEARNING HOW TO CODE
Have a clear goal
Type yourself (say no to copy and paste)
Use what you have learnt immediately
Have the mindset of fixing problems

** codewars.com
* Problem-solving: - 
Understand problem before trying to solve
Break problem into smaller pieces
Research (Google, StackOverflow, MDN)
Write pseudo-codes

* Debugging: -
finding and fixing problems(bugs)
IDENTIFY >> FIND >> FIX >> PREVENT REPETITION

* console.warn
 console.error
 console.table(objectVariable): tabulates index and value
GOTO >>Sources on chrome>> click js file>> set breakpoints to set where execution stops (clicking left part of numberings)
* include 'debugger;' at breakpoint in code

// closePane = document.querySelector(".modal_close-btn") >>> setting closePane = closeBtn fails, having same call target '.modal_close-btn'
